      <h2>Well what is coffee?</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a very old drink that has been consumed for centuries, It can be very bitter if not made correctly but
        when made right it can be very smooth and lovely tasting.</p>
        <p>Coffee is made by roasting coffee beans and then grinding them into a powder.</p>
        <p>Once made into a powder you put it ontop of a filter and pour hot water into it slowly so it can drip lovely coffee down into your cup 
          and thats just one way to make it!</p>

      <h2>The history of coffee</h2>
      <p>Coffee is very old, over a thousand years old! <br/>
        Coffee was first said to be discovered in 850 AD which is 1,173 years ago.. <br/>
        To put that into perspective the USA is only 248 years old.</p>
      <p>Acording to the National coffee asociation The oldest trace of coffee can be linked back to ancient Ethiopia. <br/>
        In which its said that a farmer seen his goats eating from a bush and then didn't sleep for the night, so he started sharing that information and Bang! Coffee invented. <br/>
      It was eaten as a berry to keep people energized eventually switching to bean. <br/>
       then being sold through the entire ancient middle east during the 15th century.</p>
      <p>In the 17th century it was brought to europe Woo Hoo! <br/> After being being drunk in europe for awhile it went to america, eventually being picked americas prefered drink. 
        <br/> Out of tea and coffee anyway, This was because of the super tax on tea in the war of independance against the brittish!</p>

      <p>Welcome to the info section of the website, where i talk about some of the non obvious things about the webside.</p>
      <p>A good place to start would be, Whats with the glowy navigation bar that dissapears when we scroll down? <br/>
      Well im glad you asked, it was a bit of a nightmare to get working as it loved sitting places it shouldn't sit!<br/>
      After It sitting where it should i used some nifty javascript to detect when anyone scrolls down, then it goes through some code <br/>
      so it knows to make the Nav bar dissapear! Neat huh?</p>
      <p>Fun fact about the background gradient <br/>
        turns out it was kinda difficult to make them in the past but now its just one CSS command, put a few colours in it and and angle and bang! Gradient!</p>
