      <h2>Well what is coffee?</h2>
        <p>Coffee is a very old drink that has been consumed for centuries, It can be very bitter if not made correctly but
        when made right it can be very smooth and lovely tasting.</p>
        <p>Coffe is made by roasting coffee beans and then grinding them into a powder.</p>
        <p>Once made into a powder you put it ontop of a filter and pour hot water into it slowly so it can drip lovely coffee down into your cup 
          and thats just one way to make it!</p>
